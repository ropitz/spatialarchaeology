    "Archaeologists regularly work with maps and data about where sites, samples and objects are found. We ask lots of questions that have a spatial component. Examples of archaeological questions about space and place include: Which Bronze Age cairns are close to the coast in England? In this excavation, is bone found inside a building or outside in the yard? In archaeology space and place matter. It's important to learn to work with spatial data and maps in order to succeed in a variety of careers in archaeology and heritage management. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will be looking at a group of Medieval burials from the Carmelite Monastery at Linlithgow. Archaeologists studying cemeteries might want to know which way the burials are oriented (north to south vs east to west) and if all the burials are oriented the same way. In studying a cemetery you might also want to investigate whether any burials physically overlap other burials, implying they took place at two different times. If you're thinking about family groups, you might want to check whether adults and infants and men and women are buried near one another. All these questions have a spatial component, so you need to work with spatial data to be able to answer them.\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this exercise is for you to:\n",
    "* learn to make very simple static maps\n",
    "* learn to ask simple questions using spatial data. This is sometimes referred to as 'writing queries'.\n",
    "* start thinking about the importance of spatial relationships and data in archaeology. \n",
    "\n",
    "To start working with spatial data and maps, you need to put together your toolkit. You're currently working inside something called a jupyter notebook, which will be a key part of your spatial analysis toolkit. It's a place to keep notes, pictures, code and maps together. You can add tools and data into your jupyter notebook and then use them to ask spatial questions and make maps and visualisations that help answer those questions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here's what you need to do: Work your way down the page, carefully reading the notes and comments in each cell (each box on the page) and looking through the code. Anything written with a # symbol in front of it is a comment I've included to explain to you what the code is doing. Comments will appear in blue type. Code will be a mix of black, green and purple type. In jupyter notebooks you hit 'Ctrl+Enter' to execute the code in each cell. Once you have read and understood the comments and code hit 'Ctrl+Enter' to execute the code and then think about the results. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can make changes to the code to ask different questions. Simply double click in the cell to be able to type in it, make your changes, and re-run the code by simply hitting 'Ctrl+Enter' in the cell again. For example, if you started with code that searched for all the burials where the sex is 'female' you could change the bit of the code that says 'female' to 'male' to search for the male burials. If things go wrong, 'ctrl+z' will undo your changes and you can try again!\n",
