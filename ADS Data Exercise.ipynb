    "### Exercise - exploring published data from the ADS\n",
    "\n",
    "To start working with the data from the ADS, you need to put together your toolkit. You're currently working inside something called a jupyter notebook, which will be a key part of your analysis toolkit. It's a place to keep notes, pictures, code and maps together. You can add tools and data into your jupyter notebook and then use them to ask questions and make maps and visualisations that help answer those questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's what you need to do: Work your way down the page, carefully reading the notes and comments in each cell (each box on the page) and looking through the code. Anything written with a # symbol in front of it is a comment I've included to explain to you what the code is doing. Comments will appear in blue type. Code will be a mix of black, green and purple type. In jupyter notebooks you hit 'Ctrl+Enter' to execute the code in each cell. Once you have read and understood the comments and code hit 'Ctrl+Enter' to execute the code and then think about the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can make changes to the code to ask different questions. Simply double click in the cell to be able to type in it, make your changes, and re-run the code by simply hitting 'Ctrl+Enter' in the cell again. If things go wrong, 'ctrl+z' will undo your changes and you can try again!\n",
