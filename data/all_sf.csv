314,Terracotta altar (arula),"terracotta altar: Fabric: Pinkish brown clay (2.5YR 8/8), sandy fabric with consistently sized black inclusions.

Maximum preserved dimensions: base 11.1 x 10.9 cm; height 11 cm

The object is a roughly square box shape, with a flat base and four walls extending upward at roughly a 90 degree angle. Emulating the monolithic altar form, both the base and upper rim are framed by irregularly spaced decorative bands of varying thickness (.5 cm to 3.4 cm). The four sides of the object are roughly 2 cm thick, with a hollow interior.

Condition: Preserves roughly 85% of the square base, with wall heights in varying degrees of preservation- only one corner of the arula preserves the complete profile from base to rim. In addition to the broken walls and base, in many instances the arula’s decorative bands are also chipped or entirely broken off.

Obv: Head of Minerva, helmeted, left. 
Rev: Horse’s head, wearing bridle, right. Legend not preserved.

Additional Notes: Due to the state of preservation, it is not possible to provide a more secure reference, but this coin can be confidently linked with either 17/1a and 17/1c, which differ in their arrangement of the reverse legend. Few types pair a helmeted deity with a horse’s head. As recorded by Crawford, 17/1a and 17/1c are the only types to feature a left facing, helmeted and beardless deity.
The diameter and weight corresponds well with the measurements for this denomination and type.

Head of Apollo, fillet not visible, right. Border of dots.
Poorly preserved. Left back leg, underside, and right foreleg of animal, walking right, discernible. 

Notes: Obverse type resembles BM 1889,1106.139 with respect to the arrangement of hair on the top of the head and the shape of the nose. However, arrangement of hair above the brow differs. The deity is perhaps wearing a laurel or other type of vegetal crown. The obverse was also struck off flan, obscuring the hair at the nape of the neck. A secure identification is further complicated by corrosion on the obverse. 
The stance of the animal on the reverse resembles the arrangement of the walking lions on RRC 16/1a. 
If the identification is correct, the weight is above average for the double litra but within the weight range for this denomination.

412,Terracotta altar (arula),"Material: Terracotta; Fabric: Reddish orange clay (10.0R 7/10), with small inclusions.

Maximum preserved dimensions: base 14 x 8.5 cm; height 14.5 cm

The object is a rectangular shape, with a flat top and four walls. The walls of the short sides extend upward and flare inward in a wave-like decoration (Wellenband). One of the long sides is without decoration, while the other contains relief decoration, identified as Europa and the bull. Emulating the monolithic altar form, both the base and upper rim are framed by thick decorative bands (3 cm). The four walls of the object are roughly 2 cm thick, with a regularly hollowed interior. Remains of cream colored coating, with some evidence of red pigment on the two figures.

Iconography: The rape of Europa; pictures Europa riding a bull. 

Condition: Preserves rectangular base, three walls remain and extend upward. One short wall of the rectangular “box” is broken off, though the other three preserve the original profile of the arula.

Material: Terracotta; Fabric: Cream colored clay (7/1 5GY), fabric has large black inclusions. Traces of white pigment

Description: The object is roughly square box shape, with a flat base and four walls extending upward irregularly. Emulating the monolithic altar form, the base is framed by irregularly spaced decorative bands of varying thickness (.3 cm to .9 cm). The four sides of the object are roughly 1 cm thick, with a hollow interior.

Condition:  Base well preserved with breaks along the border in two places; the profile of the arula appears incomplete and broken, with none of the original border remaining. Contains numerous cracks, with one major crack running down one side. One side appears to be damaged while firing, with air bubbles and associated cracking.

Measurements: Maximum preserved dimensions: base 9.5 x 9.4 cm; height 9.5 cm

Description: 

The object is a roughly square box shape, with a flat base and four walls extending upward with great irregularity. Emulating the monolithic altar form, the base is framed by irregularly spaced decorative bands of varying thickness (.2 cm to 1.1 cm). The four sides of the object are roughly 1 cm thick, with a hollow interior. Remains of cream-colored coating. The base is stamped with a simple rosette motif of dots in a radiating line (Bernardini LVI 21). Petit stampi

Condition: Preserves the square base with four breaks along the decorative border. One such break extends upward with much of the original exterior wall broken off. The profile of the arula is complete, though the walls are preserved at varying heights. The hollowed interior conforms to a roughly circular shape, with walls in varying degrees of thickness.

630,Painted Tile,"painted with red and black; from above tomb 48
A ceramic tile made from yellowish white clay with many inclusions. The shape of the tile is unusual as it seems to have consisted of a flat pan with at least three raised sides. The main, painted façade survives nearly intact, but ridges on the lateral sides of the back surface reveal that the sides were originally as high as the front. The main façade is missing small portions along the upper right edge and at the lower right corner, and the left edge is missing entirely. The entire frontal surface and the right side are decorated with a geometric motif, painted in red and black against a white background. The decorative scheme consists of a box motif, comprised of alternating black and red boxes or lozenges. A border of black paint lines the upper and right edges as well as the right side, while a border of red lines the bottom. The painting is uneven. A monogram of the letter A with a horizontal crossbeam is inscribed into the left half of the front.
L. 43.6; W. 14.2-19.7; H. 13.
Comparanda: There is no direct comparison for this type of tile. The box pattern motif most closely resembles the decoration painted on roof tiles from Rusellae n.5.D.4 (Winter, fig. 5.24); Caere Ill.6.1.2. 6.A.1.c (Winter, 407) and Satricum 6.1. 6.A.1.a (Winter, 407). The motif can be found more generally at Veii-Piazza D’Armi Ill. Roof 4-1, Ill. 4.5.1, n.4.D.1.a, Ill. 4.5.2., n.4.D.1.b (Winter, 226, 251); Tuscania-Ara del Tufo Ill. Roof 4-6 (Winter, 232); Caere-Vigna Parrocchiale II.A.4.2 (Moretti Sgubini 2001, 133).

645,Terracotta altar (Arula),"fragment of terracotta altar

Material: Terracotta; Fabric: Pinkish clay (10 YR 8/3), with some large brown inclusions

Measurements: Maximum preserved dimensions: base 9 x 10.9 cm; height 8 cm

Description: 

The object appears to have once conformed to a roughly square box shape, with a flat base and walls extending upward, though the fragment preserves only two walls. The base is framed by irregularly spaced decorative bands of varying thickness (.2- .4 cm). The two remaining walls of the object are roughly 2 cm thick, with a hollowed interior.

Condition: Preserves roughly 50% of the once square base, forming a triangular fragment with only one corner of walls meeting preserved. The profile is not preserved and the edges are broken irregularly.

678,Bronze Lunate Pendant,"bronze bulla in tomb 50
Folded sheet bronze, held together along the flattened circular edge by five lengths of flat bronze wire wrapped through circular holes. Bronze rings at the corners suggest attachment to a chain. The surface of the bronze is undecorated. Recognized in excavation as a single fragmentary object, reconstructed post-excavation. It is assumed that the piece was symmetrical but one side is damaged (missing one of the bronze rings and 20% of the edge) and the corrosion of the surviving surface makes any decoration difficult to see.

Mould-made animal figurine, likely a boar or bull based on the identifying features. Evidence of finger marks on the inside. Set on roughly rectangular base, the animal is in a standing position with short legs, a robust, rounded body, a short curling tail, and a dorsal ridge.

Condition: Preserves the base and most of the body, with the notable exception of the head. Minor breaks and chips also occur along the legs, base, and tail.

This stamp is very beaten up but seems to be similar to Oxe, A., Comfort, H. 2000. Potter number 991, IVLIVS. It is similar to the short, three letter stamps within a simple rectangle in this category yet it is not very clear due to wear. Oxe, Comfort suggests that approximate date is 10 BCE to 10 AD and with the location as Pozzuoli on plain ware.This sherd is unslipped and strange on the backside of the piece, perhaps that is what they mean by plain ware. -Mercedes Sisk, 2017 ",Stamp,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,,5323,,,,,,

1089,Terracotta votive equine,"rear end of cow or donkey

Material: Terracotta; Fabric: Tan clay (2.5YR 8/10) with grey interior (10.0 YR 7/2), inconsistent fabric with clusters of small black micaceous inclusions.

Measurements: Maximum preserved dimensions: base 4 x 6.7 cm; height 11.8 cm; top 9.6 x 5.3 cm

Description: Mould- made votive equine with rectangular base supporting the figure. The equine is attached to the base with hooves and a tail, and the area between limbs is filled in. The body of the equine is well formed, with hooves and tail hair incised.

Condition: Approximately 75% of the base has broken off, with only the area roughly supporting the hooves and tail remaining. While the back end of the equine is well preserved, the votive figure is broken just below the base of the figure’s neck and head, with the head, neck, and legs missing.

1123,"Fragment of bronze tripod leg, T.51","in situ. 
This SF number has been used in the catalogue to refer to the tripod legs as a whole, although the legs were found distributed throughout the fill. Another piece SF1130 was originally given its own number - this separation is preserved in the ARK but simplified for the catalogue due to the conservation consolidation of various pieces of tripod leg found in the same vicinity. 

This bronze tripod consists of a circular band of sheet bronze (Δ1127) with the upper rim decorated with a horizontal band of large bosses, flanked by two rows of smaller bosses. Vertical bands of the same pattern are irregularly spaced along the band. Three holes in a triangle (3 sets) of holes are visible along the band where the legs would have been attached by bronze pins (now missing).  Each of the three tripod legs (Δ1123) consist of a central rod, bent outwards at the base, attached by pins to two conjoined curved rods of corded bronze that flare up and outwards and reattach to the central rod in the lower third. The tripod was found in multiple pieces throughout several layers of fill and has been partially reconstructed (see Gabii ARK for further detail). The twisted cords of two legs are detached from the central rod and one has been bent out of shape. The third leg has also detached and one of the corded portions has broken off near the central attachment point. The band is not complete and has sections missing along it. Unclear if this was originally a single piece.
H. leg 18; H. band 3.5; Circum. band 40; Diam. band 12.5.
Comparanda: No direct formal comparisons are known for this particular tripod design but similar designs with horizontal bands have been found at La Rustica t.238.28 (Baths of Diocletian); Castel di Decima t.15.43-44 (NS 1975, 277-281), t.123, t.110 (DdA, pl. 15.25a-b); Pratica di Mare-Lavinium t.L.34 (CLP, 303 pl. 77); Satricum t.2.46 (CLP, 342 pl. 92); Rome-Esquiline t.87 (Capitoline); Osteria t.bronze chariot (Villa Giulia).; Falerii-Montarano t.15(xxvii) (Villa Giulia). The leg design is also rare, although elements are similar to Castel di Decima t.15.35 (NS 1975, 277). The above examples of banded tripods often have supports between the legs; no evidence of this was found on this example.

Fragment found with this label - either an unreconstructable piece or a sherd from another vessel/fill found during conservation. 

Widely-flaring lip which is pierced at one end by two irregular holes for suspension; shallow rounded bowl with a circular depression at the bottom; tall, hollow, fenestrated trumpet foot. Undecorated. Burnished exterior with a uniform color, and could be considered bucchero due to the grey core although it lacks the fine quality and smooth surface characteristic of bucchero. Reconstructed from twelve pieces. The foot is incomplete, missing 15% of the circumference and large sections of the foot. A small portion of the base of the bowl and the rim are also missing. Small chips and surface abrasions are present on the rim and along breaks.

Vertical bands of the same pattern are irregularly spaced along the band. Three holes in a triangle (3 sets) of holes are visible along the band where the legs would have been attached by bronze pins (now missing).

1131,Bronze Cista,"T. 51; in situ
This bronze cista is made of sheet metal decorated using repousse technique and decorated with rows of circular bosses, often alternating in size between large and small. The circular lid is decorated with concentric circles of bosses in alternating size while the handle is decorated with two rows of large bosses and is bent upwards along the edges. The lid has a downward lip that slips over the body of the cista and is decorated with a horizontal row of bosses. The body of the cista is decorated with a horizontal band of large bosses in the upper zone with vertical bands of bosses in alternating size in the lower zone. The handle and lid are attached to the body by a series of pins that connect via bronze rings to the base of the cista. The reconstruction of the mechanism suggests that the lid could not be completely removed from the body of the cista but only raised. This piece was reconstructed from a large number of bronze fragments found in situ and both the body and lid are incomplete. 
H. body 6.5; Diam. 15; H. handle 9.
Comparanda: The combination of decorative pattern and attachment mechanism is rare, with the closest comparanda coming from cistae from Rome-Esquiline Group 103 (CLP 138, pl. 21, Capitoline); La Rustica t.238.24 (Baths of Diocletian). See also OdO t.116.38; Castel di Decima t.110 (DdA, pl. 14.23). The shape is often identified as a pyxis (CLP 138), or as a tàlaros (Pitzalis 2010, 216). It may have been used for some element of female toiletry or as a container for wool, but its exact function is unclear.

Burnished exterior of uniform color, although it lacks the high gloss, smooth surface, and deep black color characteristic of bucchero. Possible evidence of usewear on the interior of the shoulder where small vertical incisions were discovered. The handle was reconstructed from two pieces and reattached in conservation, with a chip at the apex. Body reconstructed from four pieces with two sections missing, one from the body and one from the shoulder and neck. Some cracks in the body of the vessel.

Sits on a hollow, trumpet foot which is decorated with carved and incised geometric designs, that comprise deep circular impressions and thick carved lines which have diagonal incisions within them. Similar carved lines decorate the underside of the foot, possibly to improve stability. Burnished exterior with an uneven mottled coloring, likely due to uneven reduction firing.

Initially assigned to two rings, new number assigned to the other ring SF2493 during study 16/7/2017.
Goes with fibula 1141, conserved together

This large bronze suspension ring is made of two layers of bronze sheet metal and has a rhomboidal section. Both sides are decorated with an irregular incised zigzag pattern along the outer edge while the inner edge is undecorated. Found with bronze suspension ring (Δ2493) and separated during conservation. Associated with a bronze fibula (Δ1141) which was found on top during excavation and they were conserved together. The ring was likely suspended from the fibula.
W. ring 1.6; Diam. ext. 12.2.
Comparanda: Suspension rings of this type have a long history in Latin burials, appearing within Latium from the 9th-7th c. B.C. They usually appear paired with elaborate fibulae, and multiple sizes of suspension ring have been documented (see Iaia 2007 for discussion of distribution and significance). This particular combination of size and decoration has closest parallels at Osteria dell’Osa (type 45g) and La Rustica and is associated with female burials of all ages, see OdO t.226.2a, t.171.10, t.99.12, t.178.27, t.82.83/3; La Rustica t.238.16, t.81.23 (Baths of Diocletian), t.11.12, 14-16, 18-20 (CLP, 158-59 pl. 26). Similar examples of different sizes are known from Castel di Decima t.262 (DdA, pl. 20.41a), t.132.4 (NS 1975, 383); Sermoneta di Caracupa t.41.2-3. (CLP, 362 pl. 48); Marino-Riserva del Truglio t.30.29 (CLP, 90 pl. 9), t.3.16 (Gierow, 152); Rome-Esquiline t.86.2-3 (Colonna, pl. 137), t.21.7-10; Rome-Quirinal t.1 (Capitoline); Tivoli t.43.6B-D (CLP, 198 pl. 36), t.24b.9A (CLP, 201 pl. 38); Crustumerium t.141.7 (Di Gennaro, 130-31).

1136,Large Bronze Fibula with Bone and Amber Disks,"Fibula with amber beads; T 51; in situ
Small bags of unincorporated bone disc and amber fragments, as well as a small piece of silver (unclear how that is part of the fibula). Stored with SF1150 - the pin fragment
Large bronze fibula with a thin circular arch, decorated with several bone and amber discs. Two bone disks flank a central space that probably held a large amber piece. These thick bone discs are decorated with a row of circular depressions with small holes in the bottom. Two smaller similarly-decorated disks on either side show the remains of the amber studs that originally filled the circular depressions. Thin bone slivers are present on each side of the large bone discs. The catch and most of the pin of this fibula are not preserved and the central portion of the arch is broken. A 3.6cm bronze pin fragment (Δ1150) has been associated with the fibula and is likely part of the missing portion. The discs of amber and bone are particularly delicate and not all the elements are fully preserved. The amber discs are only preserved towards the foot, where they flank one of the smaller bone discs. It is probable that a large amber piece was in the central section, and the amber pieces and bone discs were symmetrical and arranged in descending order of size to mimic the curve of the fibula arch. The thin bone slivers are only preserved on both sides of one of the smaller bone discs and on one side of the other smaller bone disc. Small fragments of bone disk and amber that could not be incorporated during conservation support this interpretation. A small curved piece of silver has also been associated with this fibula but the reconstruction is unclear.
Max. diam. of disc 4; L. 7.
Comparanda: Discs of bone and amber on bronze fibulae are fairly common prestige items in Latin graves, from Period IIA onwards. Due to preservation issues, it can be hard to identify exact comparanda and such designs do not appear to be limited to one size of fibula or a specific number of bone discs or amber pieces. These particular decorations of the bone discs has no direct comparanda (cp: OdO 39b) but the closest comparanda can be found at Castel di Decima t.214 (DdA, pl. 17.39, pl. 22.3). For some representative examples, see OdO t.161.7, t.226.6, t.178.26; La Rustica t.238.16; t.81.16 (Baths of Diocletian).

1137,Small Impasto Bruno Amphora,"T. 51; in situ
Two plain pinched handles from rim to shoulder; outward-flaring lip; neck slopes inwards; rounded belly; flat base. Shoulder is decorated with closely-spaced narrow shallow ribbing that flanks the handle attachments. Burnished exterior with uniform color, although it lacks the high gloss, smooth surface, and deep black color characteristic of bucchero. Abrasion of the surface on the base suggests a reddish core, but this could also be burial accretion. Found sitting inside the bronze bowl (Δ1138). Complete. Bronze accretion on the base is likely a result of contact with the bronze bowl during burial.

1138,Bronze Bowl,"Bronze bowl; T. 51; in situ
This sheet-bronze bowl is hemispherical with no visible decoration. A bronze ring is attached with a pin on the upper edge of the bowl. Found with a small two-handled cup inside (Δ1137). Size and shape suggests a tentative reconstruction of its original placement on top of the miniature bronze tripod. Partially reconstructed from several fragments, only the rim survives.
Diam. 16.5; H. reconstructed 8.
Comparanda: The fragmentary nature of the bowl makes reconstruction of the full profile or any decoration difficult (see OdO type 81d). Similar bowls include La Rustica t.238.25, t.11.9 (Baths of Diocletian); OdO t.601.17; Castel di Decima t.110 (DdA, pl. 14.22), t.138 (DdA, pl. 15.27), t.15.34 (NS 1975, 275-76). Bowls with rounded bases are often raised on tripods, such as Pratica di Mare-Lavinium t.L (CLP, 303 pl. 77) but in this instance, the two objects were not found in close proximity and this reconstruction is unlikely.

Small bag of leftover dirt (with minuscule pieces of bronze and amber visible) and a small bags of unincorporated bone disc and amber fragments. 
Large bronze fibula with an elongated pin and triangular catch. Thin arch with a rectangular cross-section and two sets of horizontal striations towards the head. Several decorative discs of amber and carved bone are threaded onto the arch. One large ovoid piece of amber is flanked by several thin bone discs with thicker bone discs on each side decorated with a row of small circles, each circle consisting of three incised concentric circles. Further out are more layers of thin bone discs and another amber disk. The discs of amber and bone are particularly delicate and not all elements are fully preserved. The smaller amber disk is only preserved at the foot and the thin bone discs are also fragmentary. It is probable that the amber pieces and discs were symmetrical and arranged in descending order of size to mimic the curve of the fibula arch. Small fragments of bone disk and amber that could not be incorporated during conservation support this interpretation.

1210,Four Faience Scaraboid Eggs,"Tomb 52.  Material and object type unclear at time of excavation but thought to be shell or bone. During conservation, these were reconstructed into four separate objects. A single delta number is assigned to the group although the decoration varies slightly for each egg. 
White faience; hollow; egg-shaped, with one curved and one flat face. The flat reverse has a central fused seam with gaps at each end which would allow them to be threaded and worn as necklaces. The curved face of each scaraboid is decorated with a different figural scene, with a combination of pierced-through and relief carving. The bottom quarter of each is decorated with rows of carved dots, either representing the ground or a basket (Hölbl, vol. 2, 29). Found on the bronze patera (Δ1211) and excavated as a single SU for later reconstruction. Variable preservation; green staining.
H. 3; W. 2.2; D: 1.4. Slight variation in size due to reconstruction process.
1: Animal figure, possibly a sphinx or lion, possibly wearing an Egyptian crown. Seated on a three-legged stool, flanked by vertical lines. Complete.
2: Figure, possibly a baboon with a pronounced spiral, possibly a crown, emerging from the back of the figure. Seated on a three-legged stool flanked by two vertical lines, with spiral designs on the outside. Fragmentary, partially reconstructed.
3: Wide three-legged stool, with a central figure flanked by outward curving spirals. Extremely fragmentary and incomplete.
4: Figure, human or animal, with a spiral, possibly a crown, emerging from behind the head. Seated on a three-legged stool, flanked by vertical lines with outward curving spirals on the outside.
Comparanda: The form of these objects appears to mimic a cowry shell, although their style of decoration is reminiscent of the seal of an Egyptian scarab. An almost identical set of five complete “eggs” with similar iconography were found in Cerveteri-Monte Abatone t.4 (Hölbl, cat.92.96) Hölbl (vol. 2, 29) identifies the iconography of the human figure as the Horus child and the animal figure as the Egyptian goddess Bastet, seated on a “nub” sign. He identifies the curved shapes that flank the central figure as snakes (uraei), and the crowns as representing the dual crown of Upper and Lower Egypt. Only a few are attested in the Mediterranean, and they have been labelled by Hölbl as Cypraea moneta, and are related to Egyptian cowroids as a result of their cowry-shell shape (Hayes1959, 399). Hölbl identifies the workmanship as Egyptian from the Nubian period, although the basis for this is unclear. The link to Cyprus is also not supported by specific comparanda. See Hölbl, vol. 1 127-28 for further discussion. See also Capua-Fornaci t.365.38 (Melandri, 40 pl. 11) for an undecorated cowrie shell as an ornament. Melandri (360) associates the use of cowrie shells in general with unmarried women as a symbol of fertility, with links to Neolithic European practices. Whether this interpretation can be applied to the decorated faience artefacts is debatable and more examples would be needed to verify an association between the items and adult or juvenile female graves. 
Date: Insufficient close comparanda for a specific date but, based on parallels and the overall date of the tomb, Period III-IV is probable.

2032,Silver Beads associated with Silver Pendant SF2031,"New delta assigned as part of study 30/5/2017. Drawing has incorrect SF number (1204).
Unclear where these beads and the associated pendant were found, no SF/SU number appears to refer to them. Likely discovered during later microexcavation by Sara, the conservator of bulk excavated remains. Unclear how the SF1204 came to be associated with it. Different SF number given to the pendant. 
Several small bags of silver beads (as identified by conservator and illustrator), some are small coiled springs, other are cylindrical, reconstructed design based on instances where cylinders appear to be fused to springs, suggesting they hang down. 
One bag of silver fragments (too small to be reconstructed 0.91g)
Two bags of beads. Columnar beads = 8 frags, 0.69g, spiral beads = 16 frags, 0.79g. 

These silver beads come in two main shapes: tight spirals that were likely threaded onto a cord and flared columnar beads that appear to have been fused at one end to spiral beads. They have been associated with the silver pendant (Δ2031) and a suggested reconstruction has these beads alternating along a necklace chain with the columnar beads hanging down on alternating spiral beads. These silver fragments were recovered during conservation and are highly fragmentary, making exact reconstruction of the design difficult. Not all fragments could be consolidated into recognizable shapes.
W. approx. 1.
Comparanda: No direct comparanda has been found, although the overall design of pendant is similar to those from Falerii-Montarano t.17(xxvi) (Villa Giulia). The silver fragments are reminiscent of elements on silver items of unknown function, which have been identified as a hairpin from Rome-Esquiline, t.100.4 (Capitoline). The shape is also similar to a smaller pendant from Marino-Riserva del Truglio t.30.58 (Gierow, 217). This pendant could be considered a protective amulet, or bulla, similar to the more standard shape from Gabii t.50 Δ678, but this is speculative. See above, t.50 Δ678, for further discussion on bullae. 
Date: Insufficient close comparanda for a specific date but, based on parallels and the overall date of the tomb, Period III-IV is probable.

Several fragments associated that could not be reconstructed.

 Folded, hollow, sheet bronze of indeterminate shape; surviving fragments suggest an elongated trapezoidal shape.

Likely discovered during later microexcavation by Sara, the conservator of bulk deposits. Unclear how the SF1204 came to be associated with it. Different SF number given to the silver beads. 
One bag of silver fragments (14frags 0.85g) may be the remains of the decorated edge. 
weight of pendant 2.93g

This circular pendant is formed from a single piece of sheet bronze that has been folded and crimped at one end to form a cylindrical gap through which a chain or string could be threaded. It is decorated with silver foil that has a lightly incised design of an eight-pointed star, each edge made of two parallel lines, with three concentric circles at the center. Curved silver fragments, some with a protruding zigzag design may be the remains of a decorated exterior edge. It has been associated with silver columnar beads and silver spiral beads (Δ2034) based on similar material, possibly forming a necklace. The pendant was reconstructed from several metal fragments recovered during conservation and the silver foil only survives to cover part of the front face of the pendant, making exact reconstruction of the design difficult.

2040,"Bronze swastika plaques, bosses, and springs from T.53","Microexcavated out of SU3624 in conservation. location in clumps was noted and marked and pieces are now associated with subdivisions of this find in relation to where on the body they were discovered. A small number near the head, some on the main trunk, some towards one side, some on the legs. A map/plan of this exists as made by Sara and Anna when they excavated the pieces. Some joins may be across this general division due to post-depositional agents (worms) that dispersed the bronze and fragmented it, so this should be taken as a general guide rather than strict assessment. Some pieces are too small to be reconstructed, like parts of bosses, but are recognisable as such. Some pieces of this shroud were found outside SU3624 before this section was bulk-excavated. 
Includes plaques, bosses, springs and tiny cylinders. 

The bronze plaque decoration consists of several different elements, the exact relationship between them is not clear due to post-depositional disturbance. Pieces were originally arranged along the body and upper legs of the infant; several reconstructions are possible.  The care taken in decoration and the small holes for attachment suggest against an overlapping layout although some pieces were found overlapping during excavation. The bronze bosses may have been used to cap the attachment holes or may have been arranged in between. The springs are difficult to reconstruct in the context of a bronze shroud, although they may have been part of a beaded necklace or sewn directly to the fabric. There are also many other bronze fragments that could not be reconstructed into recognizable shapes.
Bronze Swastika Plaques: Approx. 24 swastika-shaped plaques, made of sheet bronze. These can be divided broadly into two groups based on the direction of the swastika prongs and the type of repousse decoration. In both types, the tips of the prongs have small holes which are likely for the attachment by wire (now lost) to fabric or leather.
L. 2.5-3.5. 
Type A: more regular form with counter-clockwise prongs; large circular boss in the center and a line of small circular bosses along the edge.
Type B: less regular form with clockwise prongs; large circular boss in the center and one large circular boss on each prong; fewer small circular bosses lining the edge.
Bronze Bosses: Approx. 80 semi-circular bosses, cut from the sheet bronze, with a small bronze loop on the underside. Diam. 0.6. 
Bronze Springs: Approx. five cylindrical bronze springs of different diameters and widths. Diam. 0.2-0.4.
Comparanda: The placement on the body is unusual as it stands in contrast to other known comparisons - such as at La Rustica t.238.12 t.81.36 (Baths of Diocletian) - where the clear placement on the head suggests a reconstruction as a headband. At La Rustica, the plaques are also found with bronze bosses and chain which were probably sewn onto a leather or fabric backing in an repetitive motif. The swastika is a common Etruscan and central Italian motif found in geometric ceramic decoration, see for example the ash urn from Montescudaio (Haynes 2000, 111), among others (Camporeale 2000, 407-8). Other fragmentary bronze swastika-plaques are known from tombs, although the number and degree of preservation at Gabii is unusual and allows a fuller sense of the original deposition. See also Veii-Quattro Fontanili  C17-18.9 (NS 1975 164-167), t.HH11-12.z1 (NS 1965 129-131); Falerii-Montarano t.15(xxvii).9 (Villa Giulia); Capua-Cappuccini Ex Polveriera t.174.53 (Melandri, 180 pl.71); Narce-Petrina t.30(XXV).4 (Civita Castellana).
Date: Insufficient close comparanda for a specific date but, based on parallels and the overall date of the tomb, Period III-IV is probable.

Several unreconstructable fragments are also associated.

Folded, hollow, sheet bronze of indeterminate shape; surviving fragments suggest an elongated curved rectangular shape. Exterior decorated through repousse with rows of small circular bosses, likely prior to the folding of the bronze sheet. Two larger bosses are also visible towards the center of the object. Highly fragmentary; reconstructed from pieces found together in situ during micro-excavation of the bronze from the infant skeleton.

Comparanda: These two pendants were found next to one another near the lower abdomen/groin of the infant. There is no evidence of a hole for a cord or wire to be threaded, although this cannot be discounted.  Poor preservation makes finding comparative examples difficult. Possible similarities to Narce t.23M.18 (Dohan, 43 pl.22); La Rustica t.11.22 (CLP, 159 pl. 25); Veii-Quattro Fontanili t.HH11-12.ee2, 8 (NS 1965 130-133); OdO t.82.53, 57, t.178.34.

2187,Neo-Atticizing Marble Fountain,"11 fragments; Photomodeled before conservation as individual fragments; Reconstructed by Tabatha Barton

The eleven fragments aligned at the breaks, and conservator Tabatha Barton was able to reattach the pieces, reconstructing about 75% of the original object, including the entirety of the circular base (27.7 cm diameter), with the exception of small chips on some of the edges, and about half of the original walls (36.5 cm).  The center of the circular base features a small circular hole of about 1.5 cm, where pipe may have been inserted for a water jet. While it was initially presumed that this was a later recutting of the object, repurposing the object as a fountain, the unusual shape and small size of the object suggest that its original intention was as a water feature. Additionally, the dulling of the features suggests consistent wear, likely by water. The concave walls and deep basin of the piece make the object’s use as an altar unlikely, and though it greatly resembled in form, style, and iconography a puteal, the small size and solid base rule out this identification. However, due to our object’s great similarity to a number of Neo-Atticizing puteals, it is likely that the piece was intended to resemble these large, well known sculptures, such as the Puteal Albani (in the Forum of Nerva) or the Puteal Scribonianum (in the Forum Romanum). It also greatly resembles large Neo-Atticizing marble vessels such as the Borghese Vase. 

Notably, there is evidence for a later repair of the object with iron pins along the wall of the fountain, suggesting the sustained use of the fountain over time.  While one pin is hidden from sight within the wall, another pin (now missing) would have been visible from the exterior, and an arm of the male figure has been cut to accommodate the repair. 

STYLE and ICONOGRAPHY
The walls of the fountain are decorated in bas-relief of the Neo-Attic style, employing a figural and drapery style meant to emulate that of fifth and fourth century Athens and Attica. The scene featured on the marble fountain, that of a Bacchic procession, is also characteristic of Neo-Atticizing. The preserved exterior walls of the vessel feature two figures, perhaps identifiable as a maenad and a young Dionysus. The first figure (“Dionysus”) is a nude male, processing forward with his left leg raised, and his right foot resting on his toes. The musculature of the figure is well defined, particularly across his abdomen and legs. The figure turns his head, looking over his shoulder, perhaps viewing the second figure behind him. While the features of the head and face are dulled and far less preserved than his body, his face is clearly clean shaven, and the appearance of a consistently raised band across the figure’s head may represent a wreath. The figure’s right arm is not visible, and the left arm is missing from the elbow down; this elbow exhibits the recutting for the iron clamp repair. 
The second figure in the procession (“the maenad”) is female, identified as such by her figure and drapery.  She stands on her toes with the balls of her feet raised, indicating motion. She is mostly nude with light drapery flowing over her left elbow, wrapping around her body and falling below her buttocks, flowing loosely around her legs. The head of the figure is thrown back with her neck exposed, her face looking upward. Although the facial features of the woman are not easily discernable, her hair appears to be arranged in a bun. The female figure carried a lyre in her arms, which is recessed from the two figures and is only distinguished by light incisions in the relief. 

This scene of a Bacchic procession is common in Neo-Atticizing reliefs, and similar examples may be seen in such famous examples as the so-called Medici Vase. Of the multitude of examples of Neo-Attic Bacchic processions, the examples most similar in form and pose to the fountain’s scene may be found on a Krater from the Museo Campano, Capua (inv. s.n.), dated to the third quarter of the first century CE (Di Franco, pp. 480-482), and a relief panel from Herculaneum (inv. 88091), dated to the Augustan period (Di Franco, pp. 435-436).

Conservation treatment 6th July 2017
Two Amber fragments with degraded surface removed from soil. Surface actively laminating off object.
Amber examined under a microscope and dry brushed lightly.
One Amber fragment left unconsolidated for provenance testing.
Larger Amber fragment with possible shaped round edges consolidated with paraloid b72 (unknown percentage but less than 20) in acrtone through immersion. Object left in paraloid until no more bubbles appeared. Excess paraloid removed with acetone and left to air dry.
Both fragments wrapped in tin foil and sealed in an unpierced box. Flakes of Amber also kept with the fragments in an unpierced bag.

Recommendations: Amber must be kept out of direct light and at a stable relative humidity (45-60% outer limit, ideally 50-55%) to prevent drying out and cracking.",Unknown,1,0,0,Sieve,0,0,NULL,"2140

This large bronze suspension ring is made of two layers of bronze sheet metal and has a rhomboidal section. Both sides are decorated with an irregular incised double-line zigzag pattern. Some chips along the exterior edge. Found with bronze suspension ring (Δ1135) and separated during conservation. Associated with a bronze fibula (Δ1142) which was found on top during excavation. The ring was likely suspended from the fibula.
W. ring 1.7; Diam. ext. 16.7.
Comparanda: Suspension rings of this type have a long history in Latin burials, appearing within Latium from the 9th-7th c. B.C. They usually appear paired with elaborate fibulae, and multiple sizes of suspension ring have been documented (see Iaia 2007 for discussion of distribution and significance).
